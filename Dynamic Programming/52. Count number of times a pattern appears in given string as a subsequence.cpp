/*

The idea is to use recursion to solve this problem. If we compare the last character of the string X[0..m] with last character of the pattern Y[0..n], there are two possibilities â€“
 
If the last character of the string is same as the last character of the pattern, we recuse for the remaining substring X[0..m-1] and Y[0..n-1]. Since we want all possible combinations, we also consider the case when current character of string do not form part of the solution. i.e. we ignore the last character of the string and recurse for the remaining substring X[0..m-1].
 
If last character of the string is different from the last character of the pattern, then we ignore the last character of the string and recurse for the remaining substring X[0..m-1]
