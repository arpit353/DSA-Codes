/*

We will off the rightmost 1 then take XOR to find the difference in the bits of number. Then we will check find its position by shifting left the 1 to right until it become 0. The no of times it took to become 0 will be the position of rightmost 1.

The idea is to unset the rightmost bit of number n and XOR the result with n. Then the position of the rightmost set bit in n will be the position of the only set bit in the result. Note that if n is odd, we can directly return 1 as first bit is always set for odd numbers.
For example, number 20 in binary is 00010100 and position of the rightmost set bit is 3.


00010100   &                   (n = 20)
00010011                       (n-1 = 19)
~~~~~~~~
00010000   ^                   (XOR result number with n)
00010100
~~~~~~~~
00000100       â€” rightmost set bit will tell us the position
