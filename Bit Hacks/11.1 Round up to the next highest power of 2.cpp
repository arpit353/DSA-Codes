The idea is to unset rightmost bit of n till only one bit is left which will be the last set bit of the given number. To handle the case when n itself is power of 2, we decrement n by 1 in the beginning. Note that this operation will not have any impact on output as weâ€™re only concerned about last set bit of n.

1 '1' bit will be left at the end as n & n-1 is in while. So when it will become 0 n value will not change.

	while (n & n - 1)
